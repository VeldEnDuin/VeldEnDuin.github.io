## BEACH AND DUNES

The nudist beach will be closed in 2020. In this way there will be more beach available for tourism. Bredene counts on the good sense of its visitors and a social distancing team and the local police will monitor the situation closely. 

The most visited beach posts are 1,2,3 and 6. These posts can be closed if necessary. 

Day tourists are only allowed at posts 4 and 6bis (the former nudist beach).

The beach will be divided in clearly indicated zones. There are zones where one can sit (soft sand), zones that function as corridors, zones for the beach cabins and zones where one cannot sit but where one can freely circulate (wet sand). 

### Dogs 

Dogs are only allowed in the beach areas beyond the beach post 1 (Twinsclub) as far as the border with Oostende. 

Dogs are NOT allowed this summer in the beach area between beach post 6 and the nudistsâ€™ beach!

### VLIZ

What we also know from an article from [VLIZ](https://vliz.be/) is that ["the risk on COVID infection from sea water and sand"](http://www.vliz.be/nl/news?p=show&id=8348) is minimal.
