## Plants and flowers

We appreciate a variation of plants and flowers, which are nicely kept and colourful. A philosophy which becomes clear as soon as you enter our campsite. Therefore we have carefully chosen local flowers and plants which we maintain daily. Enjoy! <br>


## Ecology

Going green is synonym with respecting ecology. We are contributing as follows:

- the use of sun boilers for the luxury apartments and for the new sanitary blocks
- separate waste collection
- separate waste water to be provided when new plots are being constructed
- energy-saving shower heads

Each resident disposes of separate water, electricity and gas meters. In this way you are being encouraged to reduce your ecological foot print. We also do a warm appeal to our tenants not to waste any energy.

We are really committed! We were one of the pilot companies in the recreational trade to take part in a project about **sustainable enterpreneurship**. In a nutshell: we got a screening and practical advice to continue in the same direction.<br>
Please consult our [sustainability report] [pdf_mvo.en].
