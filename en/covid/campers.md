## WHAT IF YOU NEED TO CANCEL DUE TO COVID-19

* If your stay cannot continue because the campsite is still compulsorily closed, you can keep the amount already paid for a new reservation (validity period: 1 year).
* In case of infection of yourself or your family members, you must of course stay at home. Then the same rules apply as for mandatory closure of the campsite.


## FOREIGN GUESTS

Foreign guests must register 48 hours before arrival via the [PUBLIC HEALTH PASSENGER LOCATOR FORM](https://travel.info-coronavirus.be/public-health-passenger-locator-form) and have a negative PCR test (<72 hours old) when traveling to Belgium.
All details about the current regulations can be found on [this website](https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/travels/).
The measures you must respect when returning depend on the country and it is best to request them in advance.

## CHECK-IN AND CHECK-OUT

* Check-in: from 14:00
* Check-out: before 11:00

### CHECK-IN

To avoid big crowds at the reception we work as much as possible with self-checkin.
This means that we give you a plan of the camping and an access code beforehand so
you can drive straight to your pitch.

We contact you some days before arrival to make arrangements for this.
Please call us when you have arrived at your pitch. You can then choose a quiet moment
at the reception to collect shower coins, garbage bags, ...

### CHECK-OUT

Please clear your pitch in time for the next reservation.
Please give us a call to let us know the pitch is free again.
