# Entertainment Veld & Duin

During the Easter Holidays we are organizing two main activities amongst which an Easter eggs hunt and game.

During the high season we offer a varied entertainment program. As we feel very strongly about originality, we will try to find new and inspiring activities. So keep an eye on our calendar for a complete and current survey.

At the end of the year we are going to organize a cosy mulled wine evening. A good opportunity to look back at the past year and to look forward to the coming season.
