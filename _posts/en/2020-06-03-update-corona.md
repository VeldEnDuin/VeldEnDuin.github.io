We are very pleased that tourism can reopen from 8th June (borders open 15th June). This means that you can again rent a chalet or apartment or come with your camper or caravan. 

Attention: at this moment we still need to keep our sanitary block closed. This means that only guests with their own sanitary facilities can come. We expect this to change in the coming weeks.
