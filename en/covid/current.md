## Current guidelines
According to the Ministerial Decree, campsites are closed to the public until March 1. An exception to this mandatory closure applies to the holiday homes, chalets, mobile homes and camping facilities (campers and touring caravans that are self-sufficient) that are used by the owner and / or his household.

In concrete terms, our second-handers can come and the campers that have their own sanitary facilities. Our rental is on hold for a while, but we hope to be able to reopen it as soon as possible.

## Mouth mask duty
Face masks remain mandatory in shops and shopping streets, public buildings, public transport and everywhere where no distance can be kept.

## Beach and dunes
There is no mandatory mouth mask on the beach. Walking is possible with a maximum of 4 people.
