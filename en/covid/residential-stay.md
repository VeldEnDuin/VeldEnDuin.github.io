## FOREIGN GUESTS
Foreign guests must register 48 hours before arrival via the [PUBLIC HEALTH PASSENGER LOCATOR FORM](https://travel.info-coronavirus.be/public-health-passenger-locator-form) and have a negative PCR test (<72 hours old) when traveling to Belgium.

All details about the current regulations can be found on [this website](https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/travels/).

People who arrive by car and stay in Belgium for less than 48 hours are exempt from the PCR and quarantine requirements.

The measures you must respect when returning depend on the country and it is best to request them in advance.
