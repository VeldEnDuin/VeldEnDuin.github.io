## WHAT IF YOU NEED TO CANCEL DUE TO COVID-19

* If your stay cannot continue because the campsite is still compulsorily closed, you can keep the amount already paid for a new reservation (validity period: 1 year).
* In case of infection of yourself or your family members, you must of course stay at home. Then the same rules apply as for mandatory closure of the campsite.
