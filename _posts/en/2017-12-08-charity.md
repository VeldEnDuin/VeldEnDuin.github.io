During our anniversary year we collected money for two good causes, Zorghuis Oostende and Huis aan Zee. We are very proud to announce that we have collected € 10.000 in total:

- € 5794: donations of campers, family, friends and suppliers

- € 3723,20: donation of Veld & Duin

- € 52,80: Veld & Duin-pins sold

- € 430: profits of the harvest fest


**[ZORGHUIS OOSTENDE](http://www.zorghuisoostende.be/)**

“Het Zorghuis” is like a home for cancer patients. A team of volunteers are committed to give their guests the attention and the care they need during the worst days of their treatment. “Het Zorghuis” moved earlier this year. Your donation will be used to furnish the house as comfortably as possible.

**[HUIS AAN ZEE](http://www.devloedlijn.be/huisaanzee)**

Not every child is lucky enough to grow up in a loving and stable home.
“Huis aan Zee” is a boarding school which provides permanent and temporary shelter to more than 100 children between 2,5 and 21 years old . These children are placed there (usually by the juvenile court) because they cannot get the attention they need at home for several reasons.
Your donation will be used to organise summer camps, a nice initiative and experience they can share with their friends at school.

**10.000 TIMES THANKS TO EVERYONE!!!**
