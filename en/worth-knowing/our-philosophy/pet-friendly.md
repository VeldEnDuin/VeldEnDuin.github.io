# Pet friendly
Dogs are welcome on our campsite, in the chalets and in the caravans!<br>
Unfortunately we cannot allow pets in the (luxury) apartments.<br>


## House rules
You are responsible for your dog. Please read the following very carefully:

- Dogs are admitted if kept on a lead on the camping site
- Droppings must be removed immediately
- Pets must be kept on your private plot
- Maximum 2 dogs per plot

## Letting the dog out

You can let your dog out in Paelsteenveld Park opposite the campsite or on the beach.
