What makes our playground stand out from the rest? We offer a delightful mix of the following play elements:
- Our air trampoline remains one of the childrenâ€™s favorites! The large air trampoline provides endless jumping fun and keeps their energy flowing.
- Combine water and sand and watch children create the most beautiful masterpieces! Our water play area encourages creativity and provides cooling on warm days.
- For the real adventurers, there are climbing trees to scramble up. Here, children can build their own camp and imagine themselves as forest rangers or explorers.
- Around the air trampoline, bushes grow full of delicious berries and raspberries. A healthy and natural snack, perfect for catching a breath.



Ball games are not allowed on the campsite but you are welcome to play on the beach or in Paalsteenveld park opposite the campsite.
