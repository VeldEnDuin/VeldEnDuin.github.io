# Bike friendly

Discover the other seaside resorts or the polder landscape by bike. For culture and sport adepts we advise a cycling tour to historical Bruges along the canal.


## Cycling route network

The coast and polder landscape are very much accessible thanks to [the cycle route network][fietsnet.en] which enables you to map out your own route.<br>
Veld & Duin lies at 200 m from the nearest junction of the cycle route network (junction number 56).

You can borrow these maps from the reception (warranty: € 10) or buy them at the tourist office.


## Bike friendly accommodation

Visit Flanders assigns the label "Bike friendly accommodation" to lodgings which welcome residential cyclists.
We first obtained this label in 2004 but are still committed to improve the stay of our sporty guests.

Facilities at your disposal:


- covered bicycle shed (€ 1 / bike / night) – reservations at the reception
- cycling racks near the reception and playground


## Suggestion

Take your bike on the [passage-boat][overzetboot.en] from Bredene to Oostende. Regular service and free of charge!
