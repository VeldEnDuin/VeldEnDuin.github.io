# Peace and quiet


Staying at Veld & Duin is escaping from the daily grind and charging your batteries.<br>
If, however, you are looking for a full time entertainment program or if having a holiday means partying until the early morning hours, we won’t be able to help you.

Every guest at Veld & Duin is entitled to have a good night’s sleep. We kindly ask you to respect the peace and quiet between 22.00 hrs and 08.00 hrs, also when entering the campsite by car.<br>
