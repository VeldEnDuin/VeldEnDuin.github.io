An Easter holiday without guests and our traditional Easter egg hunt feels very strange. With this video we would like to let you know that we miss you and wish you a happy Easter.
This time we replace the Easter egg hunt by a photo hunt. Look carefully at the photos, can you find the hidden Easter eggs?
