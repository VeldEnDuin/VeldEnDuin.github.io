We don't have a large field for tents, but we do offer two charming tent pitches – each with its own atmosphere and location.

Pitch A7 is located at the front of the campsite, opposite the car park and close to the sanitary facilities and playground – ideal for families with children or those who like to have everything close by. This pitch is ideal for a tent or small camper van.

Pitch C58 is located in a green, quiet corner of the campsite, further away from the large sanitary block.


## Worth knowing

- tent pitch: max 4 persons/ pitch
- electricity: 10 amps - Belgian type E plug with earth pin
- winter period 15/11-15/03: closed
