## PUBLIC HEALTH PASSENGER LOCATOR FORM

Since 1 August 2020, our foreign guests must register 48 hours before arrival in Belgium via the so-called [PUBLIC HEALTH PASSENGER LOCATOR FORM](https://travel.info-coronavirus.be/public-health-passenger-locator-form). Please arrange this before your arrival.
