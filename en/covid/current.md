## Current guidelines
The consultation committee has decided that campsites can reopen fully from 8 February.

In concrete terms, our second residents can continue to come. In addition, our rental accommodations are now also open and campers and caravans with their own sanitary facilities are again welcome.

The communal facilities (sanitary facilities, laundromat, ...) are currently still closed. These will open again on March 15th.

Non-essential travel to and from abroad is prohibited from January 27 to April 1.

## Mouth mask duty
Mouth masks remain mandatory in shops and shopping streets, public buildings, public transport and everywhere where no distance can be kept.

## Beach and dunes
Mouth masks are not mandatory on the beach. Walking is possible with a maximum of 4 people.
