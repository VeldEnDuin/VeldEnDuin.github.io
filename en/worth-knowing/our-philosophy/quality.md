# Quality

## Q-label

The [Q-label][q-label.en] stands for Quality Service among the tourism enterpreneurs along the Flemish coast.  The quality process consists of training sessions and personal coaching. The Q-label is valid for three years.

We took our chance in 2011 because we wanted to continue to invest in the services we offer. Veld & Duin received the label in June 2011. In 2014, 2017 and 2019 a new screening was done and each time we got a renewal.

The different steps to obtain the Q-label are:

- training sessions, personal coaching and company visits
- submitting a quality file and prove that the knowledge acquired is being applied
- getting a positive report from a mystery visitor who checks the friendliness, the hospitability and the cleanliness of the participating companies
