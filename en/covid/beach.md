## BEACH AND DUNES

The COVID measures for the beach and dunes are still unknown at this moment. As soon as we get more information we will post those here. 

What we do know from an article from [VLIZ](https://vliz.be/) is that ["the risk on COVID infection from sea water and sand"](http://www.vliz.be/nl/news?p=show&id=8348) is minimal.
