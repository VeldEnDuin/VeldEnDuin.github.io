We have been looking forward to it for a long time but have now finally received the green light to start our tourist rental from June 8th.
We made this welcome-back video together with a number of coastal colleagues to let us know how happy we are to be able to open again safely.
The song was written and sung by our receptionist Sander, which makes us extra proud. He appeared in [de Zeewacht][pdf_zeewacht.en] and the video was shared en masse (more than 50,000 clicks).
