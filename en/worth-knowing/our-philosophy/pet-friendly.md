# Pet friendly

Dogs are welcome on our campsite, in the chalets and in the caravans!<br>
Unfortunately we cannot allow pets in the (luxury) apartments.<br>


## House rules

You are responsible for your dog. Please read the following very carefully:

- dogs are admitted if kept on a lead on the camping site
- droppings must be removed immediately
- pets must be kept on your private plot
- maximum 2 dogs per plot
- dangerous breeds are not allowed
 
## Letting the dog out

You can let your dog out in Paelsteenveld Park opposite the campsite or on the beach. 

### Beach

- 15/10 - 15/03: Dogs can run around freely on the beach and in the sea
- 15/03 - 30/06 & 01/09 - 15/10: Dogs are allowed on the beach but must be kept on leash 
- 1/7 - 31/8: Dogs are **not allowed** on the beach **between 10.30 hrs and 18.30 hrs**. Exceptions to the rule:    
    - beach areas beyond the beach post 1 (Twinsclub) as far as the border with Oostende
    - beach area between beach post 6 and the nudistsâ€™ beach (! because of the corona measures dogs are not allowed on this beach area during the summer of 2020)
