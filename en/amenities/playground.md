# Playground

The playground is the ideal location for our youngest campers to meet up and have fun

The air trampoline (14hrs – 22hrs) is popular with all ages: it’s nice to see how toddlers are roaring with laughter at very jump and how teenagers try out some new tricks.

And there is even more to discover: the spring flowers, the climbing frame with slide, the hopscotch and the green area.
Parents and grandparents can keep an eye on their offspring from a short distance.

Ball games are not allowed on the campsite but you are welcome to play on the beach or in Paalsteenveld park opposite the campsite.
