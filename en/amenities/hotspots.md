# HOTSPOTS

There are a number of places on Veld & Duin that are very dear to us and of which we are extra proud. Because they are very special, have beautiful memories or simply beautiful to look at.
Below our favourites, but be sure to look for your own favorite spot.

## UPSIDE DOWN CARAVAN
This must-see attraction when entering is a nice reminder of the exhibition we organized for our 50th anniversary. Curious about the story? Come by, we are happy to tell you.

## THE DIVERS AND THE SAVIOR
Two works of art made by Sylvie Crutelle and Peter De Blieck.
Our 2 divers come out of the water in the surrounding greenery while the rescuer keeps an eye on everything from above. Come, look, marvel and admire.

## SPEED CAMERAS
For many of us, these viewmasters are a sweet memory of our childhood. In addition, they each reveal a specific period from the more than 50-year history of the campsite.

## ROA SQUIRREL
Roa is the pseudonym of an anonymous Belgian street artist who is now world famous. The large murals of animals, predominantly in black and white, are typical of his work. Discover his work on our graffiti wall.

## UK TELEPHONE BOX
This telephone booth dates back to the pre-cell phone era when every campsite was still required to provide a telephone for its guests. Now it is a decorative element that changes place at some point.
