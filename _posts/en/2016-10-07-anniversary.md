## 50 years Veld & Duin
In 1967 the first corn was cleared to make place for tents... in 2017 we will celebrate!

Please send us your favourite Veld & Duin holiday picture, movie or souvenir and we'll give it an honorable place in our anniversary year. We prefer pictures/movies of you and your family. Please send us these before the 11th of November.<br>
Have you got any old camping gear or memories of Veld & Duin, please contact us, maybe you can do us a great favour!

How?<br>
Per email, mail, facebook or just drop it off at our reception! We can also scan photos so that you have them back immediately.

Many thanks in advance!
