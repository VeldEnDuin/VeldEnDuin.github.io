## FOREIGN GUESTS
Foreign guests must register 48 hours before arrival via the [PUBLIC HEALTH PASSENGER LOCATOR FORM](https://travel.info-coronavirus.be/public-health-passenger-locator-form) and have a negative PCR test (<72 hours old) when traveling to Belgium.
All details about the current regulations can be found on [this website](https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/travels/).
The measures you must respect when returning depend on the country and it is best to request them in advance.

## Current guidelines
The consultation committee has decided that campsites can reopen fully from 8 February.

In concrete terms, our second residents can continue to come. In addition, our rental accommodations are now also open and campers and caravans are again welcome.

## Mouth mask duty
Mouth masks remain mandatory in shops and shopping streets, public buildings, public transport and everywhere where no distance can be kept.

## Beach and dunes
Mouth masks are not mandatory on the beach. Walking is possible with a maximum of 4 people.
