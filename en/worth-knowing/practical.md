## Directions by car
Follow the E40 from Brussel direction Gent, then take direction Oostende. In Oostende take right at the Kennedy roundabout direction Knokke-Heist- Blankenberge.<br>
Continue until the next roundabout and continue in the same direction. You are now on the coastal road. Follow this road for about 6 km until you reach the sign “Bredene 100 m” at the traffic lights.<br> 
Turn right and immediately go left (Driftweg). Then follow the Driftweg (name changes into Kapelstraat) for about 1 km. Pass the Europa hotel and take the first street on the right.<br>
Turn left and Veld & Duin is at about 200 m on your right hand side. Your holiday can start!

## Directions by public transport


###Train
There are direct trains leaving from several main cities in Belgium. Consult [NMBS][nmbs.en] for detailed information and timetables.

### Tram
Taking the [tram][kusttram.en] from Oostende to Bredene is nice and easy (it is about 8 km). Trams leave every ten minutes during the high season. Off season there is one every 15 minutes.<br>
Get off at the tram stop 'Renbaan' and take the stairs leading to the pedestrian tunnel. Go left (the beach is on the right hand side) and at the end of the tunnel immediately go right. Continue until the end of the cul-de-sac, go left and go down that road as far as the Fisherman Chapel. Go right into the Kapelstraat, the first street on your left hand side is the Koningin Astridlaan. Veld & Duin is the first campsite on the left.
