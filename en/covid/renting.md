## PUBLIC HEALTH PASSENGER LOCATOR FORM

Since 1 August 2020, our foreign guests must register 48 hours before arrival in Belgium via the so-called [PUBLIC HEALTH PASSENGER LOCATOR FORM](https://travel.info-coronavirus.be/public-health-passenger-locator-form). Please arrange this before your arrival.

## CHECK-IN AND CHECK-OUT

* Check-in: from 14:00
* Check-out: before 10:00

Please respect these hours of check-in and check-out so that we have sufficient time to do
a thorough control. Our apologies if your accommodation is therefore free a bit later than
expected.


### CHECK-IN

To avoid big crowds at the reception we work as much as possible with self-checkin.
This means that we leave your keys, information brochure, garbage bags and wificodes
in your rented accommodation. 

We contact you some days before arrival to make
arrangements on this.
Please choose a quiet moment at the reception the latest one day after your arrival
to pay the warranty.

### CHECK-OUT

You can leave the keys in the letterbox (opposite the reception).
Leave all windows and the (slide)door open so that your accommodation can ventilate.

Please give us a call to let us know the accommodation is free and we can then discuss the
reimbursement of the warranty.

## CLEANING

* Before your arrival the accommodation is cleaned thoroughly and all contact points
are disinfected.
* The mattress covers and pillow protectors are renewed for each reservation.
These are disposable and are only used once.
* At the end of your stay you can do the end cleaning yourself or you can ask us to do it.
When you clean yourself we expect a thorough cleaning of all the rooms. You can disinfect
but this is not obligatory as we do this ourselves everywhere.
* Please book the end cleaning at least 3 days in advance so we can plan the required staff.

## DIRECTIVES  

* The use of bed linen (sheet, duvet cover, pillow cover) is obligatory
(this can be your own or you can rent it from us).
* Cleaning materials for a normal thorough cleaning are provided.
* Disinfectant is not provided but we use this for each change of guests.
* All used kitchen utensils need to be cleaned toroughly.
* Make use of your own sanitary facilities in the accommodation instead of the public facilities.
